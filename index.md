# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about best places to travel to my dear home country. 

El Salvador its a great country where you can go to beach, mountain, volcanoe, lakes, viewsides places with just a few hours of distance. 
You can do great things in just one day. There's a lot to see and we will talk about the people, we are the most kindest and welcome citizens.
